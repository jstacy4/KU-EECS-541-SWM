Initial setup commands

$ sudo yum install git -y
$ sudo yum install gitk -y
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "Your Email"
$ git config --global credential.helper cache
$ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=86400'
$ git config --global core.editor "emacs -nw"

$ git clone https://github.com/jstacy4/KU-EECS-541-SWM.git <directory to clone to>

You now have your own copy of the git repository as well as gitk, a
graphical tool for viewing the git repository structure.

The basic workflow is to create a branch from the repository and work
off of that branch while making incremental commits to that branch.
Every once in a while it would be a good idea to push those changes on
your branch to the server.  Once you feel like the branch is ready to
merge into the master branch, you should just talk to me
(Jonathan) and we'll figure it out.

To create your branch:
$ git checkout -b my_branch

You are now on the branch 'my_branch' and all commits/pushes will be
made to that branch unless you checkout somewhere else.

Once you've made some changes/added some files you will want to add
them to git's index

To add everything in the current directory that has changes

$ git add .

To add a specific file

$ git add <file name>

Now you will want to commit these changes to your local repository

$ git commit -a 

At this point emacs (or whatever editor you chose to associate with
git) will open with a commit change log file.  Add a lovely,
descriptive and concise message detailing the changes you made at the
top of the file.  Save and close the file.  Git will then commit the
changes to your local repository.

You'll want to occasionally push your branch to the server instead of
just your local repository

$ git push

Your changes should now be added to the server.  Hooray!

Git's online documentation and tutorial is pretty good so it wouldn't
be a horrible idea to at least skim through the basic tutorial.

If you're ever wanting to push anything to the server aside from the
branch you're working on, please contact me (Jonathan) first and we
can work through it together.
