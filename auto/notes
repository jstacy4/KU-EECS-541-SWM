Note : According to tests, a satisfying control of the AR.Drone 2.0 is
reached by sending the AT-commands every 30 ms for smooth drone
movements. To prevent the drone from considering the WIFI connection
as lost, two consecutive commands must be sent within less than 2
seconds.

The maximum length of the total command cannot exceed 1024 characters;
otherwise the entire command line is rejected. This limit is hard
coded in the drone software.  Note : Incorrect AT commands should be
ignored by the drone. Nevertheless, the client should always make sure
it sends correctly formed UDP packets.

Fuck Filezilla.  Transfer files to drone in binary mode ONLY.  Causes
segfaults sometimes when it tries to automatically determine how to
send the file.
