Battery Level Query Program
Activate Battery Level Query Program from Android device over telnet
  http://learn-it-stuff.blogspot.com/2012/03/create-simple-java-android-telnet.html
Working example for sending single command.  Need to clean up the code.  Future version 
which allows interactive telnet instead of only a single command would be good in the future.

Have gps and battery level data logged to files.  Include time using format in var/log
Fly from A to B while logging said data, make a few turns.  Use existing flight commands, not gps data.

Cases for emergency stop
  Low on battery - periodically write battery level to a file and read it in main flight loop
  Outside of testing zone determined by gps location
  Loss of gps data
