Cases for emergency stop
  Low on battery - periodically write battery level to a file and read it in main flight loop
  Outside of testing zone determined by gps location
  Loss of gps data

Have gps and battery level data logged to files.  Include time using format in var/log
Fly from A to B while logging said data, make a few turns.  Use existing flight commands, not gps data.
