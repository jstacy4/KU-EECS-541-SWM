Should only need to move these executables/libraries or a subset of
them for gpsd to work on the drone.

Currently on drone:

/usr/sbin/
gpsdctl
gpsd

/usr/lib64/libgpsd*
/usr/lib64/libgps*

Maybe put on drone?:

/usr/bin/
gpsfake
gpsctl
gpsprof
gpsmon

/usr/lib/udev/gpsd.hotplug

/usr/lib/systemd/system/gpsd.service
