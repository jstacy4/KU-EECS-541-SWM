Fresh run
$ sudo killall gpsd
$ sudo rm /var/run/gpsd.sock

Download gpsd 3.8 source
Build the source
$ scons

To get GPS data from the drone:
$ sudo ./gpsd -N -D3 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock /dev/ttyUSB0
$ ./gps_test

It would seem you can't change the name of the directory in which gpsd
was built in without it losing track of the libraries.  Not sure how
this'll work out when moving stuff over to the drone.  Probably have
to put stuff into /usr/lib. - Worked on laptop.
